        <h1>SHOWER WASTE</h1>
        <p>On average, when you leave the shower on, about 16 liters of water are consumed per minute - a significant amount to which you also need to add the gas or electricity consumed to heat the water. For a 5-minute shower, the consume is about 75-90 liters of water, which increases to 160 liters of water for a 10-minute shower and 240 liters of water for a 15-minute shower.</p>

        <h2>WASTED WATER FOR 1 KG OF STEAK</h2>
        <p>To produce meat or a steak, water is used for three things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food (for the animals)</li>
            <li>Cleaning their stable</li>
            <li>Self-consumption</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Growing the food that the animals eat takes a lot of water. The reason for this is that their food is produced in almost the same way as our vegetable food. This means that if we have a dry period we also need to spray (with water) the animalsâ€™ crops. That is why the production of meat costs a lot of water. The total amount of water that is used for 1kg steak is 15,000 liters.</p>

        <h2>AGRICULTURE IN ITALY</h2>
        <p>No one in the European Union has the availability of drinking water taken from rivers, lakes and the subsoil like Italy: water consumption each year is 9.2 billion cubic meters, and we are the country in Europe that extracts the most from the ground: 84.8% according to Istat. Often this large availability of water, at least in Italy, is not managed in the most efficient way. For domestic water, 42 liters of water for every 100 introduced into the water network are lost due to old and broken pipes. The first sector for water consumption is certainly agriculture. We are talking about 40% of the total annual water consumption in Europe, even though only 9% of the fields are irrigated. In Italy, water consumption for fields, forestry and fishing amounts to 14.6 million cubic meters.</p>

        <h2>INDUSTRY IN GERMANY</h2>
        <p>In 2019, companies used a total of 15.3 billion cubic meters of fresh water. Of this amount, 84.7 percent, or almost 13 billion cubic meters, was used exclusively for cooling power generation and generation plants. The water used for production accounted for 10.7% of the total quantity. The remaining share went to irrigation, mainly in agriculture (2.5%) or was used in manufacturing (1.4%).</p>

        <h2>HOW DO YOU WASH YOUR DISHES</h2>
        <p>The water consumption of a modern dishwasher is quite low, with the possibility of using just 6 liters of water for a complete wash cycle by choosing a model of the best energy class. On average, the water consumption of a dishwasher is about 10-12 liters, which is significantly lower than manual washing of dishes which requires about 50 liters of water.</p>

        <h2>CONSUMED WATER IN A WASHING MACHINE</h2>
        <p>Currently, 8 kg washing machines consume about 40-50 liters of water for each cycle and are the most chosen to meet the daily needs of a medium-sized family. Medium-small washing machines, about 7 kg, consume about 30-40 liters for each wash, an amount that can be further reduced with the necessary precautions.</p>

        <h2>How much water do you think the average household consumes in a day?</h2>
        <p>Compared to other European countries, we are wasters of the amount of drinking water consumed. The average daily water consumption is about 220 litres per person. The calculation for a family is quickly done; it is enough to multiply the value by the number of members of a family. Per year the average consumption of an Italian family is about 200 cubic meters.</p>

        <h2>How much water do you think a leaky sink can waste in a day?</h2>
        <p>The waste of water from a leaky tap depends on how often it drips. Just to give a few figures, a tap that leaks 90 drops per minute releases 4,000 liters of water per year. Even a small loss (20 drops per minute) would be enough to waste almost 900 liters of water a year... More than what a human being consumes in 12 months to quench his thirst.</p>

        <h2>How much water do you think the production of a shirt consumes?</h2>
        <p>The water footprint of tissues is a crucial factor to consider for environmentally responsible shopping. We use 79 million cubic metres of water annually to produce our clothes, and 2,700 litres of water are needed to make a simple white T-shirt.</p>
